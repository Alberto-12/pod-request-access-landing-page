- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript


### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to make the landing page interactive by using Javascript



```js
 proudOfThisFunc validate(e){
    e.preventDefault();

    if (email.value === '') {
        message.innerHTML = 'Oops! check your email';
    } else if (!pattern.test(email.value)) {
        message.innerHTML = 'Oops! check your email';
    } else {
        message.innerHTML = '';
       
    }
   
}
}
```

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to improve on Javascript.
